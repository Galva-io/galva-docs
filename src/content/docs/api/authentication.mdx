description: Learn how to authenticate API requests using your API key
---

All API requests require authentication using an API key. This guide explains how to obtain your API key and use it to authenticate your requests.

## Getting Your API Key

To find your API key:

1. Log in to your dashboard
2. Navigate to your app settings
3. Your API key will be displayed in the settings page

Your API key follows the format: `sk_xxxxxxxxx`

:::caution Keep your API key secure
Treat your API key like a password. Never share it publicly or commit it to version control. If your API key is compromised, regenerate it immediately from your app settings.
:::

## Using Your API Key

Authenticate all API requests by including your API key in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer authentication scheme.

### Header Format

```
Authorization: Bearer sk_xxxxxxxxx
```

### Example Requests

#### cURL

```bash
curl https://api.galva.io/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_xxxxxxxxx"
```

#### JavaScript (fetch)

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.galva.io/', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_xxxxxxxxx',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

#### Python (requests)

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_xxxxxxxxx',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get('https://api.galva.io/', headers=headers)
```

#### Node.js (axios)

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const response = await axios.get('https://api.galva.io/', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_xxxxxxxxx'
  }
});
```

## Authentication Errors

If your API key is missing, invalid, or expired, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid API key",
    "type": "authentication_error"
  }
}
```

If you receive this error, verify that:
- Your API key is correctly formatted (starts with `sk_`)
- The API key is included in the `Authorization` header
- The header uses the `Bearer` authentication scheme
- Your API key hasn't been revoked or expired
