title: Admin API Overview
description: Comprehensive guide to the Galva Admin API for server-side integration
---

The Galva Admin API enables you to manage user data, sync subscription states, and trigger lifecycle events from your backend server. This API is designed for server-to-server communication and provides full control over user profiles and subscription management.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```text title="Base URL"
https://api.galva.io/v1/
```

## Key Features

### User Profile Management
- Create and update user profiles with custom traits
- Sync subscription entitlements and states
- Track lifetime value (LTV) and custom attributes

### Bulk Operations
- Import historical user data in batches
- Process up to 1,000 users per request
- Asynchronous processing for large datasets

### Lifecycle Events
- Trigger subscription lifecycle workflows
- Log real-time events (subscriptions, renewals, cancellations)
- Automate win-back, save, and payment recovery campaigns

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/v1/identify` | POST | Create or update a single user profile |
| `/v1/batch-identify` | POST | Bulk import historical user data |
| `/v1/events` | POST | Trigger lifecycle events and workflows |

## Authentication

All Admin API requests require authentication using an Admin API key. See the [Authentication](/api/admin/authentication) page for detailed instructions.

## Getting Started

1. **Generate an Admin API Key** - Navigate to your app settings to create an API key
2. **Review Data Objects** - Understand the [shared data structures](/api/admin/data-objects) used across endpoints
3. **Choose Your Endpoint** - Select the appropriate endpoint for your use case:
   - Use `/identify` for real-time user updates
   - Use `/batch-identify` for historical data imports
   - Use `/events` to trigger automation workflows

## Use Cases

### Real-Time Sync
Keep Galva in sync with your database by calling `/identify` whenever user data changes:
- New user registration
- Profile updates (email, name, attributes)
- Subscription state changes

### Historical Backfill
Import existing users from your database using `/batch-identify`:
- One-time migration of user data
- Bulk updates without triggering workflows
- Safe background processing

### Event-Driven Workflows
Trigger automated campaigns with `/events`:
- Send win-back emails when subscriptions expire
- Launch save campaigns when users cancel
- Recover failed payments with targeted messaging

## Rate Limits

- **Standard Rate Limit**: 100 requests per minute per API key
- **Batch Endpoint**: 10 requests per minute (max 1,000 users per request)
- **Burst Allowance**: Short bursts up to 150 requests per minute

:::tip Best Practices
For optimal performance:
- Use `/batch-identify` for bulk operations instead of multiple `/identify` calls
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limit errors (429)
- Cache API keys securely and rotate them periodically
